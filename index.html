        <h2>My dream or goals</h2>
        <p>
            My goal in life is to become a succesfulman. All i want in life is that in the future i am able to pull things together and able to have enough food, money and have a beautiful house
        but not the best one or a bad one i just want a normal house. this might not be a succesfulman but in my opinion, it is.
    
        <br>
    <br>
    Throughout my life I always see so many cartoons with snow. In my home country, the phillipines. There are never any snow its always summer, summer and summer. I always dreamt to play in the snow, make a snowman and have a snowball fight and try skiing.
    <br>
    <br>
     My second dream in my life is to to travel around the world and eat their national dish and popular food there and explore tons of popular locations in the country like the most popular scenery there and buildings.
